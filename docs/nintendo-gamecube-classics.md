# Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics

(last stop on our emulator tour — here are 20 solo-friendly picks ordered with your “quick-burst, not-too-brutal” play style in mind)

## How I chose them
- #1-10 are confirmed launch or “coming soon” titles Nintendo has publicly listed for the GameCube app on Switch 2.
- #11-20 are front-runner classics that haven’t been formally dated yet but are widely tipped by first-party press kits and partner teases. I’ve star-marked these as (✱ Speculative) so you can track what’s official versus “very likely next”.

## Quick-start suggestions for Ty
- Wind Waker or Luigi’s Mansion for story-rich 15-minute chapters.
- F-Zero GX and Kirby Air Ride for “pick up, race, quit” adrenaline.
- Pokémon XD when you feel like light grinding that still moves a plot.
- Chibi-Robo or Animal Crossing if you just need a cosy bite of dopamine.

(✱ Speculative titles are not yet on the service but are the most-requested GC classics; keep an eye on monthly NSO news drops.)

Happy sailing, vacuuming, and ghost-busting! Let me know which of these intrigues you most, or if you’d like deeper dives—e.g., “Would you like to learn more about the Wind Waker speed-sailing tricks?”
